# Introduction

Guardians of the Galaxy: The Bet is a top-down shooter game based on Marvel's The Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. This project was developed by 29 students from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia during their third year of studies, using a C++/OpenGL engine developed by the students themselves.

This project took approximately four months to complete, with meetings every two weeks to plan and evaluate the work done over the weeks and determine whether or not to make any necessary changes. In addition to the meetings, the students divided into groups to organize themselves more easily. These groups were divided according to the branch of work to be completed: Design, Art, and Programming. Although I personally preferred the design team, I ended up working on the art team to be more efficient. Until then, I had always been assigned artistic tasks. Since this was a large-scale joint project, I preferred to remain on the art team to make things easier.

## First and second week

The first few weeks of the project were dedicated to choosing the visual style and how the characters would look in the game. At that time, we focused on conceptualizing some characters and testing them to see how they would look and what challenges we would face when converting them to 3D models.

The hardest part was giving the characters an original design that maintained the character's essence. It wasn't enough to copy the look from other sources like comics or movies; we had to design the characters to look original and still work within the game.

<br>

## Third and fouth week

Over the following weeks, the design team gave us feedback on which characters would ultimately be in the game, allowing us to focus our conceptualization on those characters to see what they would look like. Two other colleagues and I created some concepts for the protagonist, Star-Lord, and some enemies. The design team also brainstormed ideas for the game's first areas, so during this time, we worked on drawing the different biomes and characters the design team had in mind.

## Fifth and sixth week

For the fifth and sixth weeks, we focused on refining the designs we'd created in the previous weeks to better fit the project. Some professors advised us to exaggerate the characters' proportions to achieve a more stylized finish. So, during this time, we focused on improving the current designs and began preparing the character turnarounds for later modeling in Autodesk Maya.

The new versions had clearer, more defined silhouettes and fewer small details that wouldn't be visible in the engine. However, as the biome section became increasingly busy, the art team split up, and I was left in charge of character design. The design team asked us for a basic soldier-like enemy, a large enemy that could handle heavy machinery and withstand multiple attacks from the player, and a fast enemy that could attack in melee.

It took me a couple of iterations, but thanks to the advice from the professors and the communication between the design team and the art team, we achieved stylized designs that met the design team's expectations.

## Seventh and eighth week

During these weeks, our development time was extended due to the workload. By the time the character design adjustments were made, part of the 3D modeling had already begun, so during these weeks the art team had to continue producing while retouching the work done previously.

During these weeks, I was in charge of reworking the melee enemy model and fixing a couple of issues that arose with its texturing. Additionally, the design team added a miniboss to the workload. So, once the melee enemy was finished, I was assigned to model and texturize both the new miniboss (which was designed by a colleague) and the tank enemy I designed myself.

## Tenth and eleventh week

By the tenth week, we were already approaching the deadline, and for the first time, the design team assigned us the conceptualization of the cinematics. For this, they gave us a script with the text and the characters that would appear, and my job was to draw different comic pages based on the design script. The cinematics would be displayed as if the player were reading a Guardians of the Galaxy comic. I was also assigned the design and modeling of the game's final boss, which was the character Thanos.

For this character, I followed the same conceptualization process, however, this time I modeled it first in ZBrush and then did the retopology in Autodesk Maya. This gave me more freedom when it came to creating details and the character's anatomy, which was helpful since this character was the largest in the project and would be the one with the most noticeable details.

## Twelfth and thirteenth week

Over the next few weeks, all the modeling work was completed, and the art team was able to focus on developing the cinematics. While the majority of the team was polishing and fixing some issues, a colleague and I began to fine-tune the cinematics. Until now, I was in charge of conceptualizing the script, which the designer provided, but now I had to move from the concept to the polished drawing, allowing another colleague to complete the line art and, finally, color the pages.
