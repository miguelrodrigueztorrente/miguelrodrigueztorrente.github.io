# Introduction

Guardians of the Galaxy: The Bet is a top-down shooter game based on Marvel's The Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. This project was developed by 29 students from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia during their third year of studies, using a C++/OpenGL engine developed by the students themselves.

This project took approximately four months to complete, with meetings every two weeks to plan and evaluate the work done over the weeks and determine whether or not to make any necessary changes. In addition to the meetings, the students divided into groups to organize themselves more easily. These groups were divided according to the branch of work to be completed: Design, Art, and Programming. Although I personally preferred the design team, I ended up working on the art team to be more efficient. Until then, I had always been assigned artistic tasks. Since this was a large-scale joint project, I preferred to remain on the art team to make things easier.

## First and second week

The first few weeks of the project were dedicated to choosing the visual style and how the characters would look in the game. At that time, we focused on conceptualizing some characters and testing them to see how they would look and what challenges we would face when converting them to 3D models.

The hardest part was giving the characters an original design that maintained the character's essence. It wasn't enough to copy the look from other sources like comics or movies; we had to design the characters to look original and still work within the game.

## Third and fouth week

Over the following weeks, the design team gave us feedback on which characters would ultimately be in the game, allowing us to focus our conceptualization on those characters to see what they would look like. Two other colleagues and I created some concepts for the protagonist, Star-Lord, and some enemies. The design team also brainstormed ideas for the game's first areas, so during this time, we worked on drawing the different biomes and characters the design team had in mind.

## Fifth and sixth week

For the fifth and sixth weeks, we focused on refining the designs we'd created in the previous weeks to better fit the project. Some professors advised us to exaggerate the characters' proportions to achieve a more stylized finish. So, during this time, we focused on improving the current designs and began preparing the character turnarounds for later modeling in Autodesk Maya.

The new versions had clearer, more defined silhouettes and fewer small details that wouldn't be visible in the engine. However, as the biome section became increasingly busy, the art team split up, and I was left in charge of character design. The design team asked us for a basic soldier-like enemy, a large enemy that could handle heavy machinery and withstand multiple attacks from the player, and a fast enemy that could attack in melee.

It took me a couple of iterations, but thanks to the advice from the professors and the communication between the design team and the art team, we achieved stylized designs that met the design team's expectations.
