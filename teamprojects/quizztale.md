# Introduction

Quizz Tale is a trivia game developed by four people for a university game jam. In this game, the player must answer as many questions correctly as possible to help the protagonist achieve her dream of becoming an astronaut. Depending on the player's decisions and correct answers, the story will lead to a good or bad ending.

## Initial Concept

This was the first game jam and one of the first games I participated in developing. For this project, there were four people, including myself, who all worked on the game design. However, two colleagues were in charge of programming, while another colleague and I worked on the game art.

Since we had just entered university, we knew we couldn't make an overly complicated game, so we decided to keep it simple so we could polish and fix any issues that arose during development. A big inspiration for the game's design was another trivia game called Majotori by Alva Majo. In this game, the future of several characters depends on the number of questions the player answers correctly, and the number of correct answers increases the probability of a good ending.

However, in order not to copy Majotori, we decided that in our game the number of correct answers would not increase the probability, but that the player would need a minimum number already established to be able to get the good ending instead.

## Final Version and development process

Once we had the idea for the game in mind, we had to get right to developing it, since we only had three days for the game jam we were participating in. We spent part of the first day conceiving the idea, so the following days we divided into the programming and art teams and got down to developing the game.

As part of the art team, my job, along with a colleague, was to create the illustrations that would depict the different events in our character's story. To create these illustrations and save as much time as possible, we used a pixel art technique similar to other games like Undertale by Toby Fox.

In this game, when the player enters combat, the enemy is shown in full monochrome with occasional colored elements depending on the enemy. To save time, we decided to use this same technique and draw all events in white on a black background. We also took as a reference the occasional color in some of the game's battles and decided that our illustrations would always have at least one colored element.

In addition to the visual style, I was also in charge of creating the designs for some of the story's characters, especially the protagonist's. Since this was a game in which the character was growing, I wanted to add some element to the character that would remain the same over time so the player could always recognize her at a glance. We came up with the idea of using the spiky pigtails I drew in one of the illustrations of the protagonist when she was a child, and we decided to keep them as she grew. At first, we thought that if the protagonist always wore pigtails, it would be harder to show that she had grown, so we only kept the two pigtails themselves, so if her hair grew, it would end up in two pigtails, instead of just having two very long pigtails.

The protagonist's adult hair design ended up resembling a mermaid's tail; however, we liked how it served to identify the character and resulted in an original style, so we decided to keep it. We even took advantage of this feature and added the pigtails themselves to the game's logo to give it more personality.
