# Introduction

Bardakedabra is an plattformer indie game made with Unity where the player has to avoid a series of obstacles which appear faster as the games goes on. It is strongly inspired by the famous endless runner Google's Dinosaur Game but each run the player has the chance to improve the character so it gets further every run.
