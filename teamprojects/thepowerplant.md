# Introduction

The Power Plant is a third-person action level design developed by two people and recreated in blockout with the Unreal Engine. It was designed alongside four other sections of a big level to tell a fragment of the story of a game similar to The Last of Us, that is, a third-person action game set in a post-apocalyptic world full of zombies. 

The Power Plant is the fourth of the five sections of the level that would make up the first part of the story, composed of the town suburbs, the sewers, the woods, the power plant, and the lighthouse, in that order. In this part of the level the player must sneak into a power plant full of zombies and restore the power to be able to get out of it and reach the cliff where the lighthouse is.

Each section has its guimmicks and characteristics that differentiate them from the rest, the power plant being the alternate
Use between two types of zombies when they are or are not exposed to light, the crowbar and the use of electricity as puzzles to advance in the level. In addition, the escape section caused by the change of the level (the activation of the light system by activating the electricity).

## Narrative

After reaching the road and following it for a while, the player arrives outside the power plant. After considering his options, he decides to break into the facilities. He finds his way inside easily after breaking into the guards building and jumping through a window on the second floor. Once inside the facilities, he continues his path until he arrives at another access, a broken bridge that crosses the chanel. To cross safely, the player goes into the main building to restore the power and activate a dam near the broken bridge.

He/she ventures across the abandoned and dark rooms without encountering any zombie related problems because the zombies appear to act more calmly without light. He/she then reaches the generator room, and activates the energy switch, after restoring one broken mechanism. Once the power is restored, the light returns and the zombies become more active than before. The player then begins his escape, fighting and evading the zombies until he exits the building. Then, he/she activates the dam, crosses it, and continues his path following the road.

## Player Objective

The main objective is to infiltrate the power plant and restore the power to activate the dam that allows the player to continue his path. To do this, the player must avoid the zombies inside the facility, find and use the crowbar to open the doors blocked with wooden planks, and place the missing gears in the generator room.

## Gameplay

This part of the level can be divided into three segments: infiltration, going to the generator, and escape.

<br>

### Infiltration

Just at the start of the level the player has to find a way to enter the facilities, as the main gate is closed. Next to the door there is a building and, after climbing his way inside, the player will find himself on a second floor with a closed door at his right and some stairs that go down to the first floor at his left. At the first floor, there will be a zombie (the old security guard) and the key to open said door. Once inside the closed room on the second floor, the player will find a series of windows, one of them being open, which will allow him/her to finally enter the facilities.

<br>

### Going to the generator:

When sneaking into the facilities, the player falls from the window into an area with a closed fence (a see-through fencing), which will force him to enter the building in front. Once inside the building, the player will encounter a couple of zombies, with whom he/she will discover that when they are inside buildings without light, the zombies behave tamely, teaching the player this behavior as a tutorial. When the player exits the building, he/she will discover a dam that will serve as an exit, but which he/she cannot activate because the electricity is not connected.

After that the player must enter the only remaining building to try to find the switch that gets the electricity back on. Inside this building he/she must find a crowbar in the second floor (the first floor is inaccessible through the entrance), avoiding the range of vision of a zombie, to break a wall and sneak into a room that will allow the player to access the first floor through a hole in the floor. This will leave the player with no possibility of return, forcing him to advance forward until he/she is outside again but behind the building. There he/she will find a new building (the generator room) with the button to recover electricity inside. However, the button will not work because one of the gears in the room is missing. The player must find the remaining gear while avoiding the zombies in the room in order to press the button and recover the electricity.

<br>

### Escape

Once the electricity is activated, the player will only have one direction to go, which will be sneaking back to the previous building via a jump from the generator room. Once inside, the player will find himself in a room with a zombie, and when he leaves it he will return to the second floor where he/she founded the crowbar (due to a group of debris that served as fencing). This will force him to follow an alternative route, which will take him over a bridge (with see-through fencing to see the exit of the power plant from there and thus locate the player in the map) to the next building.

In said building the player has to avoid a series of zombies without being seen until leaving the building through the first floor. Once outside, the player will find himself back outside again next to the exit, which will allow him to activate the dam this time and successfully escape the facilities.
