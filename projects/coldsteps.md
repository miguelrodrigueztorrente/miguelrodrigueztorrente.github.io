# Introduction

Cloudtrop Garden is a plattform level design for the Super Mario saga, specifically for the Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988) game. “Gardens in the clouds with flying boats” would be the way to summarize the theme of the level in one sentence.

It is mainly inspired by a track of the Mario Kart 8 video game, Cloudtop Cruise, in which the entire scenario is set in a walk through the clouds which are crossed by different giant pods that grow from the ground and some flying battleships.

</div>

Part of the inspiration when making the level was to create a level that would allow the player to run freely through gardens in the clouds and in some circumstances be able to access the flying ships that flew over them.

Most of the airship levels in the Super Mario saga are reserved for boss levels, the idea was to bring a calmer version of these levels and adapt it to a Super Mario “cloud” level, usually those in which the world is set in the clouds, such as the world 5 of Super Mario Bros. 3(1988) or the world 7 of Super Mario Bros. Wii(2009). 

<div class="text-center p-4">

</div>

With this idea in mind and the Cloudtop Cruise reference, I decided in advance the different mechanics that would make up the level.

First, the main power up of the level would be the super leaf, which is usually ideal for levels in the clouds due to its ability to glide and elevate the flight when reaching the maximum speed running. It can also perform a spinning attack with its tail to defeat enemies.

Afterwards, the level will be divided into 3 different areas which will be interspersed with each other and are differentiated by theme, gameplay and difficulty.

<li type="disk"><b>Gardens</b>: The easiest difficulty areas, set in green areas with bushes where the player can run long distances freely without fear of falling into the void (except for a specific jump). They are also the areas where the enemies of the level are found.</li>

<br>

<li type="disk"><b>Platforms</b>: Areas of intermediate difficulty intended for pure platforming. They are recognizable by being wooden surfaces held by one or several posts. They also appear occasionally in garden sections to increase the difficulty of the jumps and add variability.</li>

<br>

<li type="disk"><b>Airships</b>: The most difficult areas of the level, known for mixing platforms with different enemies. They usually have a bonus area at the end of the section that is accessed from a pipe. To access these areas you need to find the climbing vine or use the power up to fly up.</li>

<br>

Then I selected some mechanics in line with the theme of the different areas. With the garden areas, the ramps and curves would be used to slide and the vines to access the airships, and in the airships the pipes can be used to access the interior of the ship.

Finally, the enemies that are used in the level are:

<li type="disk"><b>Galoombas</b>: Similar to Goombas except that jumping on them does not destroy them but rather knocks them down, allowing the player to grab them to eliminate other enemies. I chose this enemy because in addition to being a basic enemy to defeat with a jump, it is easier to deal with it with the super leaf and it encourages the player to use the grab mechanic, which is used by pressing the run button, used also to fly with the super leaf.</li>

<br>

<li type="disk"><b>Wiggler</b>: Mechanically an evolution of the Galoomba, since in addition to being larger it is not knocked down when jumping on top, but also when doing so it gets angry and chases the player. It is also a rare enemy in the saga, which increases the differentiation of the level from the rest. This enemy can be defeated with a tail attack from the super leaf and can usually be found in settings with forests, gardens, pipes and some special levels.
</li>

<br>

<li type="disk"><b>Bullet Bill</b>: Enemy that constantly spun and moves in a straight line through the air. He can be defeated in one fell swoop and is useful for compromising the player's jump on other occasions.</li>

<br>

<li type="disk"><b>Canon Ball</b>: Similar to bullet bills but they are smaller in size, which makes them more difficult to eliminate and they can also move diagonally.</li>

<br>

<li type="disk"><b>Boomerang Bro</b>: Enemies that throw boomerangs, which advance in a straight line and then return in the same direction. They are enemies that move slightly to the sides and jump constantly (they climb onto the platform above them if it is less than five blocks high) making it difficult to eliminate them.</li>

# Prototypes

<br>

## First version

When I first tried to do the level, I had two main problems. The first was that I still didn't have all the main mechanics clear and the second was that I was putting together my level using parts or segments of other official Super Mario levels. Furthermore, I was setting up the level trying to replicate the Level Design concepts without taking into account whether I found it fun or not.

<br>

## Second version

For the second version (which was the one my classmates were able to play in the playesting session), I focused mainly on creating a level that was fun to play, but since I still didn't have the main mechanics clear, the level was an amalgamation of areas without any relation between them.

By then I was clear that I wanted a cloud world level, and I tried to use the wind gusts (which are usually used in aquatic levels) from the editor, however, even though it was fun to interact with them, thanks to playtesting, I realized that they were not very intuitive and were difficult to use to mutate the gameplay.

That's why after finding the Cloudtop cruise reference I discarded that mechanic and focused first on finding the main mechanics of the level mentioned above.

Also taking advantage of the feedback from playtesting, I focused on the idea of creating a level so that the player had space to run, since it was one of the things they liked the most about the level.This would be reflected in the garden areas, which are the largest areas and without fewer drops in level.

<br>

## Final version and design process

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="1200px" class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/XgQeBE6.jpeg">
</div>

The first thing I did before creating the level was to make a layout with paper and pencil. I did this to be able to count and calculate the jumps with greater precision as well as have a more extensive and general vision of the level.

<br>

### First Section

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="400px" class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/PnWz2s7.png">
</div>

In the first section, the first thing you see when starting the level is Mario on a small platform with a larger and more extensive one to his right and a surprise box at the top. With this I intend to encourage the player to leave their small island and venture to jump to the large platform. However, if I walk, Mario will fall into the void, so he has to jump, and since it is the first jump of the level, I have designed it so that it is a jump three blocks long and two blocks high. Mario can jump up to about 6 blocks without running so the player has plenty of room to make the jump.

Once the player advances a little on the platform, he comes across an enemy and another platform with coins on top. The enemy is an evolution of the previous salt since it is another threat of damage but now Mario no longer has a height advantage but rather they are at the same level. This is set so that the player avoids the enemy and begins to climb the platforms.

The platforms also contain an evolution of difficulty since the first and second have a distance of 2 blocks wide and 4 high, but the second and third are also 4 high but this time 3 wide.

Again we repeat the enemy concept to divert the player's attention to the boxes he has seen from the beginning, with the wiggler. Furthermore, the enemy is another evolution of difficulty in 2 senses, the first because it is a greater threat to the galoomba and the second because after the jump with the advantage of the beginning and the jump at the same level with the galoomba, this is a jump with a disadvantage when being the wiggler on a higher platform than Mario.

Once the player overcomes the platforms, he reaches the reward in the surprise boxes that he has seen from the beginning, however this is a misdirect since they do not contain any power up and teaches the player one of the main mechanics of the level, the climbing vine. This vine allows the player to access a new area where their true reward is, the power up of the super leaf. Finally, just after obtaining the power up, there are some coins placed as a clue to show the player how to use the power of the super leaf, since they are placed in such a way that with a normal jump they cannot obtain all of them. If the player makes the jump correctly, he will fall into a pipe safe from the wiggler.

This is a platform section that serves to present the main mechanics and enemies of the level and serves as an arrival to the gardens, that is why the intensity level is medium and to regulate the pacing of the level, the following section being one of gardens is somewhat calmer.

<br>

### Section 2

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="400px" class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/l7YTh5x.png">
</div>

The level begins with a slide that automatically eliminates the two galoombas below. If the player does not slide, he still has a height advantage to jump over them.

We repeat the concept of enemy and coins to divert attention, however the wiggler is now in a lower position to give the player an advantage.

The top platforms are similar to the previous section but less demanding and present the player with the first vine that gives access to the first airship.

We repeat the concept of surprise block without power up to get the player used to hitting the brick blocks so that he can find all the hidden secrets of the level, like the vines.

<br>

### Section 3

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="400px" class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/UQO03Bz.png">
</div>

When the player reaches the top of the vine they come across one of the three airships in the level. This being the first to be presented, is medium in size and reuses the previously seen galoombas along with two new enemies, the bullet bill and the cannon balls. 

The platform is not very demanding since it is the first airship and when the player reaches the end a pipe awaits him with access to a bonus area (not shown in the layout) that contains a power up and a large amount of coins to collect. The only way to exit the bonus zone is through a pipe that leaves the player right on top of the checkpoint.

If the player does not find the path, they will have to jump on two wooden platforms and will arrive directly at the checkpoint, which is on a large platform with several margin blocks on the sides to prevent the player from accidentally falling into the void.

This is a high intensity section, which is why after this area there is again an easier garden area. However, this contains more difficulty than the first garden area to continue advancing in the evolution of level difficulty.

<br>

### Section 4

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="500px" class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/j6ufyrh.png">
</div>

Again we came across a wiggler, but to increase the difficulty unlike the previous one who was at a disadvantage, this one at the same height level as Mario.
We once again present the player with two height-disadvantaged Galoombas but they can no longer be defeated by sliding on a ramp but will have to be stomped or avoided.

If the player retains the power up of the super blade, he can try to reach the right platform directly by planning or even running, avoiding the galoombas, since this jump is the same size as the first time the power up is obtained (although this maybe there are no coins to give clues)

In case the player falls with the galoombas and tries to avoid them by going back, he will contract with a superstar to empower him and encourage him to move forward.

After overcoming the galoombas we can find different levels of difficulty, such as this time there is a moat in the garden, the wiggler now has a height advantage over Mario and the wooden platforms are more demanding than the previous garden.

Finally, from here the level can be finished in two different ways. The first following the vine that goes up towards the airships, and the second going forward.

To counteract the calm pacing of this section, both represent a peek of intensity that culminates with the arrival at the flagpole.

<br>

### Section 5

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="700px" class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/Cr72ZBe.png">
</div>

If the player follows the path upwards he will encounter two airhips, to increase the difficulty and feeling of progression.

The first ship is small in size, being shorter than the first ship in the level, this serves to misdirect the player with respect to what he has seen previously and causes a greater contrast with the ship that comes next. Additionally, the small airship includes a mechanic/enemy, the rotating canon ball.

Once the small airship has been passed, the player will see that it does not have a pipe like the previous one but instead gives way to a larger ship. This ship is a mix of the two above, having more enemies, higher and more precise jumps and more cannons, both normal and rotating.

At the end of this is the pipe that leads to the bonus area (not shown in the layout), which is guarded by two boomerang bros.
To advance the player has to press a P block that allows him to leave the bonus area, but said block is hidden behind the boomerang bros to encourage him to fight.

Once the airship bonus zone is exceeded, the pipe drops the player right on the top of the flagpole.

<br>

### Section 6

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="600px" class="img-fluid" src="https://i.imgur.com/vNOmDZ6.png">
</div>

If the player does not go up the path and decides to go to the right, the level gives way to various blocks (the wooden platform was replaced in the final version).

These blocks consist of 3 question blocks, one of which has multiple coins so that the player can collect as many as they can, with a wiggler next to them to make this difficult. Also hidden in one of the blocks is a P block, which when pressed will show a path of coins to follow.
The Modenas path continues along the wooden platforms, which are the most demanding at the level, and ends at the top of the flagpole.

In case the player does not make the last jump, a large platform is placed below to prevent his death at the end of the level (which would be frustrating).
