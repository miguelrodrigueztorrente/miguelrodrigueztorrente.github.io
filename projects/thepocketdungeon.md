# Introduction

The Pocket Dungeon is a narrative game in which the player must choose between different options to advance the story. Some of these options alter the dialogue and character conversations, while others can lead to different paths or endings, either good or bad.

## Initial Concept
The original inspiration comes from an expansion for the Hearstone game called Kobolds and Catacombs, which itself is inspired by classic Dungeons and Dragons adventures. In this expansion, the player must delve deeper into a dungeon while facing different creatures and collecting treasures with different abilities.

For this project I wanted to make a classic dungeon adventure, so I took this Hearstone expansion as a starting point, beginning by reusing the concept of a large dungeon enclosed behind a small door that appears in the trailer for said expansion.

From there, I began to shape the story by creating the different characters, each with their own unique problems and goals. The idea was to create a story where the player could choose their path, encountering these characters, but I knew I couldn't cover too much, or the ramifications of the story would be too much work. That's why I tried to create a story that could branch off at different points, but small enough to complete its narrative and give it a closed ending. This concept of a small story was what gave me the idea to make the dungeon literally small, enough to fit inside a pocket. This is how I created the beginning of the handle that summons the dungeon door.
