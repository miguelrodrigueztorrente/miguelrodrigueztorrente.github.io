# Introduction

The Pocket Dungeon is a narrative game in which the player must choose between different options to advance the story. Some of these options alter the dialogue and character conversations, while others can lead to different paths or endings, either good or bad.

## Initial Concept
The original inspiration comes from an expansion for the Hearstone game called Kobolds and Catacombs, which itself is inspired by classic Dungeons and Dragons adventures. In this expansion, the player must delve deeper into a dungeon while facing different creatures and collecting treasures with different abilities.

For this project I wanted to make a classic dungeon adventure, so I took this Hearstone expansion as a starting point, beginning by reusing the concept of a large dungeon enclosed behind a small door that appears in the trailer for said expansion.

From there, I began to shape the story by creating the different characters, each with their own unique problems and goals. The idea was to create a story where the player could choose their path, encountering these characters, but I knew I couldn't cover too much, or the ramifications of the story would be too much work. That's why I tried to create a story that could branch off at different points, but small enough to complete its narrative and give it a closed ending. This concept of a small story was what gave me the idea to make the dungeon literally small, enough to fit inside a pocket. This is how I created the beginning of the handle that summons the dungeon door.

## First Version
The first version of the game had a total of four endings. A couple of them were alternative endings to the main story, one was considered a bad ending, and the other was a true ending achieved by solving the main story of the adventure. These endings consist of an image highlighted with a frame and followed by a message mentioning the ending number and its name. However, for the first version of the game, these images were less important since the project consisted of creating a narrative adventure with Twine, and the narrative was more important. Therefore, the images, while useful for illustrating some parts of the story, were secondary at this stage of the project.

That is why, during this development phase, the character and background illustrations belonged to other existing franchises, such as Dark Souls or World of Warcraft. This helped me build the story more quickly and lighten the workload in character building; however, for future versions I knew I had to change this aspect if I wanted the project to be original.

## Second Version
The first thing I did for the second version of the project was redo all the game's images using a technique I used on a previous project called [QuizzTale](https://miguelrodrigueztorrente.github.io/teamprojects/quizztale.html). This technique involved drawing pixel art with only two colors: black for the background and white for the elements of the image. This shortened production time and achieved a distinctive style for the game. However, for some characters, I also had to make some adjustments to differentiate them slightly from their original versions.

Another technique I used to replace the old images was to remake them using photographs of real-world places and objects. In the previous image of the knight, for example, I used a stewpot as a base for drawing his helmet. On the other hand, in the illustration showing an image of the dungeon's capital, I used an image of one of the streets of Subiaco, a municipality in Italy.

Finally, for this version, I also made some adjustments to the narrative and added a new alternate ending, which turns out to be a bad ending. I added this ending near the end of the main story because I noticed that the story tended to become too linear toward the end and there weren't as many choices as there were at the beginning. That's why I added this ending as a joke, referencing a scene from one of the old Disney movies. I won't mention which one in case you want to discover it on your own.

## Final Version
Halfway through the second version, when most of the original artwork had been replaced with original pixel art, I decided to take advantage and translate the game into two additional languages that could be selected at the beginning of the story. Originally, the story was only in Spanish, but I decided to also include Catalan and English to increase the reach of potential players. The story and conversations are practically identical, except for a couple of changes to one illustration that showed a sign with letters on it.

The image and text will change depending on the language the player chooses at the beginning of the adventure.
