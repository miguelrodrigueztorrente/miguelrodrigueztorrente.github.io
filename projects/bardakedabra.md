# Introduction

Bardakedabra began as a university project to create an indie game related to sound. The original idea was to make a rhythm platform game, in which you had to avoid obstacles to the beat of the music, similar to other games like HarmoKnight. The idea was later changed to a simpler one, which consisted of creating a platform level in which the difficulty and music changed progressively over time.

For this project I had to program the game in Unity, design the sprites in pixel art with Photoshop and finally compose the music with Famitracker.

For the game's design new moves were added, which could be acquired in exchange for coins that the player had to collect in each run. This improved the character's mobility and added replayability to the game, making each run more likely to reach the end.

Because yes, this game does have an ending when you reach 9999 points, although it's simply a thank you for playing it, along with the cover image of the game.

The art and sound of the game on the other hand resembles the ones of the old Game Boy games, not only because they have a retro style that I personally like, but because it is a style that has fewer details than others and allows me to polish it with more detail.
