# Introduction

Bardakedabra is an plattformer indie game made with Unity where the player has to avoid a series of obstacles which appear faster as the games goes on. It is strongly inspired by the famous endless runner Google's Dinosaur Game but each run the player has the chance to improve the character so it gets further every run.

## Initial Version

The first concept of the game was to make a rythim and plattformer game mix, similar to another games like Harmoknight. The idea was that the player has to jump following the music beats to avoid the different obstacles. Due to time and difficulty issues i discarted this idea and changed the game's premise, which now was to avoid obstacles that progressively come faster along with an evolution in the game's music.

This way, not only i saved a lot of time in the game's development, but also to facilitate the development of the game's music, which originally was in charge of a university colleague. So, while I was creating the assets and programming the game, my partner was composing the songs for it, so we were both moving forward on the project at the same time.

For the visuals, I considered older Game Boy Color and Nes games, such as Kirby's Adventure (1993) and Pokemon Gold or Pokemon Silver (1999). Their reduced color palette was a good choice since it was easier to design and color the game's characters, saving time and allowing me to fine-tune details if necessary. It also resulted in a style that I personally liked.

In these types of games, the character color palette is usually divided into three, while the backgrounds are usually colored with two colors. In the case of characters, the colors usually consist of a main color, which is usually the most characteristic of the character, a secondary color that can be used for shadows or details, and black, which was used primarily to highlight the character's silhouette against the background, although it was also used to draw some details.

I used this same technique for this game: the backgrounds are composed of light colors, and the characters are more vibrant, highlighted by black. Both the coloring and animations were done in Photoshop, where I colored and animated the characters to see how they looked. Once they were ready, I imported them into Unity so I could program them.

Once the sprites and music were ready, the first version of the game was programmed. In this version, the player ran endlessly while avoiding the characters who acted as obstacles. The objective was to last as long as possible without colliding with anything; if they did, they would have to start the game over.

## New Version

In this state the game was a carbon copy of Dinosaur Game, which is why I decided to update the game to differentiate my game from it and be able to contribute something new. When I used to play Dinosaur Game, I got a little frustrated having to always start from scratch, which is why for the new version of Bardakedabra I decided to include replayability, this way each run would have importance.

To achieve this, I included a menu upon losing each run, where players could purchase new abilities in exchange for coins that appeared periodically during runs. This not only added replayability to the game, but also gave players new tools to help them progress further and further in each run.
